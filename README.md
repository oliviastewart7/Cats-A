Project Description:

Introduction
Urethral Obstruction (UO) is a life-threatening blockage of the lower portion of the urinary tract, which sometimes occurs as part of feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD). While there is little prior research on why UO reoccurs in some cats and not others, this analysis aims to reveal whether certain variables have a strong impact on cats returning for medical care. Additionally, we hope to provide insights to help veterinary staff improve patient outcomes and reduce hospital readmissions.


Project Goals
1.      Find potential factors of reoccuring UO through exploratory statisitcs

2.      Make recommendations to vet office staff to decrease chance of recurring UO

Dataset
The dataset in this project contained information on 105 male cats who underwent a medical procedure to treat urethral obstruction (UO). The data was collected across multiple clinics, and contained many different variables related to the cat’s diet, environment, and health, as well as many variables related to the actual medical procedure. However, as the main goal of this analysis is to identify factors that veterinarian surgeons could actually change in order to decrease the likelihood of a cat redeveloping UO after the medical procedure, the analysis focused on examining the variables most directly under vet surgeons’ control. Most of these variables are related to the medical procedure or the cat’s health measurements. After cleaning the dataset, it contained information on 87 cats.
